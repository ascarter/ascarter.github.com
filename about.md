My name is Andrew Carter. I live in Snoqualmie, WA. I am currently a Principal Software Engineering Manager in [Azure Hybrid Data](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/azure-arc/hybrid-data-services/) at [Microsoft](https://microsoft.com).

I studied Electrical Engineering at the University of Washington (1994). I've been in software engineering professionally since 1992. My past roles include [Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com), [Hulu](http://www.hulu.com), [Getty Images](http://www.gettyimages.com), and [Flipboard](http://flipboard.com). I've also spent some time at early stage startups.

I'm primarily focused on cloud services and web technology. On the side, I enjoy working with outdoor fitness technologies. I'm an avid golfer, cyclist, skier, and hockey player.
