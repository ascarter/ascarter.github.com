My name is Andrew Carter. I live near Seattle, WA. I am a software engineer for [Flipboard].

I studied Electrical Engineering at the University of Washington. Previous to Flipboard, I worked for [Amazon Web Services][aws] on [Lambda][lambda]. Before that, I worked three years for [Hulu] where I was a Principal Developer on the television devices (including extensive work on the [AppleTV][apple] application).

I started my career at [Microsoft] where I did two internships on the Mac Excel team. I worked fulltime for Microsoft from 1995 to 2005 in SQL Server, bCentral, and Xbox Live. I also have worked at several startups including Source Labs, Pure Networks, and Jobster. I also worked at Getty Images for three years as a Senior Software Engineer where my projects included contributor portals and the Flickr partnership.

Outside of work, I'm an avid cyclist and skier. I also enjoy football especially the Seattle Sounders.
