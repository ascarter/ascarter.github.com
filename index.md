My name is Andrew Carter. I'm a software engineer with more than 25 years of professional experience. I live in Snoqualmie, WA.

I am currently a Principal Software Engineering Manager in [Azure Hybrid Data](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/azure-arc/hybrid-data-services/) at [Microsoft](https://microsoft.com).

I studied [Electrical Engineering](https://www.ece.uw.edu) at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu) (1994). I'm primarily focused on cloud services and web technology. On the side, I enjoy working with outdoor fitness technologies. I'm an avid golfer, cyclist, skier, and hockey player.
