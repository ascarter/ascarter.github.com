My name is Andrew Carter. I'm a software engineer with more than 25 years of professional experience. I live in Seattle, WA.

I'm currently the Web Development Manager at [Flipboard](https://flipboard.com). I lead a small team in Seattle and Vancouver. In addition to the primary web site, I also work on content production and other backend services.

On the side, I'm working on iOS and Web projects.

My professional focus is broadly in what is now known as *cloud services* but it has been called many things throughout my career. I have a particularly strong interest in the intersection of services with the web and mobile devices.

Outside of work, I am an avid cyclist and skier.
